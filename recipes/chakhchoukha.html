    <p>
      Chakhchoukha or chekhechoukha (Arabic: شخشوخة) is a traditional Algerian
      dish made from torn or rolled pieces of cooked semolina dough that are
      served in a flavorful tomato-based sauce. The dish consists of small
      pieces of rougag (thin round flatbread) mixed with marqa, a tomato stew.
      The dish is typically made by boiling the semolina dough in salted water
      until it is cooked and then rolling it into small balls or tearing it into
      bite-sized pieces.
